//<div>s don’t inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful when we want to apply custom styles to our HTML elements. 
//<div>s allow us to group HTML elements to apply the same styles for all HTML elements inside. 
//We can also style the <div> element as a whole.

//Attributes//
One commonly used attribute is the id. 
We can use the id attribute to specify different content (such as <div>s) and is really helpful when you use an element more than once. 
ids have several different purposes in HTML, but for now, we’ll focus on how they can help us identify content on our page.

<span> *Element*
It’s best to use a <span> element when you want to target a specific piece of content that is inline, or on the same line as other text. 
f you want to divide your content into blocks, it’s better to use a <div>.
